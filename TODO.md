# TODO - Phase 2: Gripper System

## Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Implement dual sensor system (navigation 5.5cm + gripper 1cm)
- [ ] Add object spawning (cubes, cylinders)
- [ ] Implement object detection logic
- [ ] Add grasp force feedback
- [ ] Test manual grasping workflow

## Future
- [ ] Evolve gripper controllers
- [ ] Multi-objective fitness (navigate + grasp)
- [ ] DEAP integration
- [ ] Neuroevolution

## Questions to Resolve
- Should gripper sensors be separate or integrated?
- How to handle lift mechanism (future 2-DOF)?
- Object physics tuning needed?
